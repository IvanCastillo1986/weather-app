            <p>
                Howdy! My name is Ivan and this is a very simple weather application I've created
                using React, react-bootstrap, react-router-dom.
                It's one of my first projects using bootstrap, so I'm using it as a learning opportunity
                to step away from raw CSS, which is what I'm most comfortable with.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main purpose was to have a new application that's personal to me, where I could try new
                things as I learn them, since it might help to apply these new things on something that means
                more to me on a personal level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Plus, it helps me meet those beautiful GitHub contributions which might help as I look
                for work, as well as adding something new to my portfolio ;)
            </p>
        </div>
